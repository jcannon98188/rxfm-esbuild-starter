# RxFM Starter App

Welcome to the RxFM starter app! You can learn more about RxFM on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/alden12/rxfm).

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then in the app root directory run:
```sh
npm install
```

Followed by:
```sh
npm start
```

Once this has finished, open your browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to view the live app!

## Build the App

You can build the app by running:
```sh
npm run build
```

This will output the built files into the `/www/dist` folder. 

## Running Unit Tests

Run jest unit tests with automatic file change watching enabled using:
```sh
npm run test
```

Or use the tests only once:
```sh
npm run test:ci
```

This template is configured to use both Prettier and ESLint. The repository has been configured with pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards.
